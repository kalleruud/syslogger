# Run Checks and Tests After Changes

After making any code changes, you MUST:

1. Run `bun run check && bun run test` to verify the changes
2. Fix any issues that arise from the checks or tests
3. Re-run `bun run check && bun run test` until all checks pass

## Workflow

1. **Make code changes**
2. **Run verification**: `bun run check && bun run test`
3. **If checks fail**:
   - Analyze the error output carefully
   - Fix the issues (TypeScript errors, ESLint violations, Prettier formatting, test failures)
   - Go back to step 2
4. **If checks pass**: The change is complete

## What the commands do

- `bun run check`: Runs TypeScript type checking, ESLint, and Prettier
- `bun run test`: Runs the test suite with Bun's test runner

## Important notes

- Do NOT skip this step, even for "small" changes
- Do NOT ask the user if they want you to run checks - just do it
- Do NOT leave failing checks or tests for the user to fix
- If a check fails multiple times, explain what you're doing to fix it
- Mark the "Run checks and tests" todo as a separate task in your task list

## Example workflow

```bash
# After making changes to src/backend/managers/log.manager.ts
bun run check && bun run test

# If TypeScript errors appear, fix them
# If ESLint errors appear, fix them  
# If tests fail, fix the code or update the tests
# Re-run until clean

bun run check && bun run test
# ✓ All checks passed!
```

This ensures code quality and prevents regressions from being committed to the repository.
